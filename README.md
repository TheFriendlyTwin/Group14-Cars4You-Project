# Cars 4 You: Expediting Car Evaluations with ML

Repository of the Group 14 for the project Cars 4 You: Expediting Car Evaluations with ML, within the scope of the subject Machine Learning from the Data Science Master of Nova IMS' university.

## Project Goal
Create a predictive model capable of evaluating the price of a car based on the user’s input without needing the car to be taken to a mechanic.

## Files available in this repository:
- ML_Project_25_26: PDF file containing the Project details
- data:
  - sample_submission: csv file containing the price for each cardID
  - test: csv file with the dataframe to test
  - train: csv file with the dataframe to train
